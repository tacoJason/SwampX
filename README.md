# Tender 

This is our project we created for Swamphacks from 1/25/25 to 1/26/25.


## Inspiration
This app owes its debt to the beautiful kittens of UF. In an increasingly isolated society, our team felt the importance of developing an app to foster community engagement and promote campus exploration. UF happens to have a world of outdoor kittens that comfort so many students . The most famous example is Tenders, who disappeared from campus in the [past year][df1].
