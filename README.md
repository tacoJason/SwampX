# Tender 

##### Inspiration
This app owes its debt to the beautiful kittens of UF. In an increasingly isolated society, our team felt the importance of developing an app to foster community engagement, promote campus exploration, and help ensure the safety of UF's campus kitties. UF is home to a world of outdoor kittens that provide comfort and companionship for many students . The most famous example is Tenders, a kitten who went missing from campus [last year][tenders] , only to be found four miles away from her home. Thankfully, Tenders has since been safely returned. This app serves as a tool for tracking kitten sightings to help ensure their safety, and offers a community bonding platform for UF students and faculty. We hope to share the joy UF's campus kitties can bring into our lives.


Created for Swamphacks from 1/25/25 to 1/26/25.
